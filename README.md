# Image-Classification-with-ResNeXt-on-CIFAR-10
This project implements a modified ResNeXt architecture for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It explores residual blocks, grouped convolutions, and compares optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adversarial Model Perturbation. The aim is to achieve high accuracy while keeping computational complexity low.
